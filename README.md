The Storybook design system tutorial is a subset of the full [Storybook design system](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system/), created as a learning resource for those interested in learning how to write and publish a design system using best in practice techniques.

- **Build management** using **Rollup**.
- **Change management** using **Auto**.
- **CI/CD** configured with **GitHub Actions**.
